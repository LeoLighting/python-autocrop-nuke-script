I'm currently on the path of learning Python to enhance my Nuke technical abilities so I just did my first little autocrop script!
It launches the autocrop for each seleted read nodes, you can select a whole bunch of nodes it will only apply to the read nodes. If you repeat the operation it checks the already existing autocrop nodes and deletes them before doing the new autocrop.
